# **Sales Report Analysis**

## Business Overview

The sales department plays a crucial role in driving business growth and sustainability. Analyzing sales data provides valuable insights into product demand, regional sales trends, and category performance in terms of the products. It also helps identify top-performing sales representatives who contribute significantly to revenue generation.

These insights can be leveraged to:

* Recognize and reward high-performing sales representatives.

* Optimize procurement and supply chain decisions based on demand trends.

* Strategically allocate resources to maximize sales opportunities and profitability.


## Business Problem

Stakeholders at Jennyâ€™s Enterprise seek insights into sales performance to optimize business strategies. They are particularly interested in identifying the best-selling products, preferred sales channels, and underperforming regions to enhance sales and improve customer satisfaction.

To achieve this, they have tasked me with analyzing the sales dataset to answer the following key questions:

* Which are the top 10 fast-moving products?

* Which sales channel do customers prefer, and how can the company optimize it?

* Which region has the lowest sales, and what strategies can improve performance there?

* What is the overall customer satisfaction rate?

## Data Understanding

The Dataset was downloaded from kaggle under the link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vinothkannaece/sales-dataset?resource=download. It contains 1000 rows and 14 columns and is in a csv format. During the data understanding we have done data cleaning.
